# Quick Setup Guide - Fragment Navigation

## What Changed

Your app now uses **Fragments** instead of **Activities** for tabs, making the bottom navigation bar completely static (no more jumping!).

---

## Files to Build

### New Files Created:
```
app/src/main/java/com/example/scplayer/fragments/
├── HomeFragment.java
├── SearchFragment.java
└── LibraryFragment.java

app/src/main/res/layout/
├── fragment_home.xml
├── fragment_search.xml
└── fragment_library.xml
```

### Modified Files:
```
HomeActivity.java (now hosts fragments)
activity_home.xml (now has fragment container)
```

---

## Build Instructions

1. **Sync Gradle** (Rebuild Project)
   - In Android Studio: `Build → Rebuild Project`
   - Or run: `./gradlew clean build`

2. **Run the App**
   - The app will now use HomeActivity as the main container
   - All tabs will be fragments inside HomeActivity
   - Bottom navigation will be 100% static

---

## How to Test

1. ✅ Login to app
2. ✅ You'll see Home tab
3. ✅ **Tap Search tab** → Content changes, **nav bar stays perfectly still**
4. ✅ **Tap Library tab** → Content changes, **nav bar stays perfectly still**
5. ✅ **Tap Home tab** → Back to home, **nav bar stays perfectly still**

## Old Files (No Longer Needed)

These files still exist but are **NOT USED** anymore:
- ❌ `SearchActivity.java` - Can delete
- ❌ `LibraryActivity.java` - Can delete
- ❌ `activity_search.xml` - Can delete
- ❌ `activity_library.xml` - Can delete

You can safely delete them, or keep them as backup.

## Architecture

**Before (Activity-based):**
```
User taps tab → finish() → startActivity() → onCreate() → EVERYTHING RELOADS
```

**Now (Fragment-based):**
```
User taps tab → hide old fragment → show new fragment → ONLY CONTENT CHANGES
```

---

## Result

🎯 **Bottom navigation bar is now 100% static - ZERO jumping!**

The navbar lives in HomeActivity and never recreates. Only the fragment content swaps! 🚀
